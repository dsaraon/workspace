** Do we want to record when a user was last active?

** Using chat_ID and message_sent as primary keys won't work if messages can be sent simultaneously!

** Is server assigning chat IDs?
	-- If so, how does it check if a chat has been open previously?
	
** What to do on delete (of user)?
	-- Add constraints if messages are deleted
